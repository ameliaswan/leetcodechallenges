-- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-followers-count/

-- Write an SQL query that will, for each user, return the number of followers.
-- Return the result table ordered by user_id.


-- using COUNT(user_id) as followers_count runs much faster than COUNT(follower_id)
SELECT user_id, COUNT(user_id) AS followers_count FROM Followers
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY user_id
;


-- SELECT user_id, COUNT(follower_id) AS followers_count FROM Followers
-- GROUP BY user_id
-- ORDER BY user_id
