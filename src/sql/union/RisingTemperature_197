-- DATE_SUB / DATE_ADD should both work well
select w1.id from Weather w1, Weather w2
where w2.recordDate = Date_sub(w1.recordDate, interval 1 day)
and w1.temperature > w2.temperature
;


-- DATEDIFF is much slower
select w1.id from Weather w1, Weather w2
where DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
and w1.temperature > w2.temperature
;
