-- Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
--
-- "Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
-- "Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
-- "Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

select t.id,
    case
        when t.p_id is null then 'Root'
        when t.id in (select p_id from Tree t1) then 'Inner'
        else 'Leaf'
    end
as 'type'
from Tree t
